How to use 100-matrix_mul.py
==============================
This module defines a matrix multiplication function ``matrix_mul(m_a, m_b)``.

Usage
=====
``matrix_mul(...)`` returns a new matrix representing the multiplication of
``m_a`` by ``m_b``.

::
	>>> mul = __import__("100-matrix_mul").matrix_mul
	>>> x = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
	>>> y = [[1, 1], [1, 1]]
	>>> mul(x, y)
	[[3, 3], [7, 7]]

Testing for integers
::

	>>> x = [[1.5, 2.5], [3, 4]]
	>>> y = [[1, 1], [1, 1]]
	>>> mul(x, y)
	[[4.0, 4.0], [7, 7]]

Testing for floatss
::

	>>> x = ([1.5, 2.5], [3, 4])
        >>> y = [[1, 1], [1, 1]]
        >>> mul(x, y)
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	TypeError: m_a must be a list

Testing x as a tuple
::

        >>> x = [[1.5, 2.5], [3, 4]]
        >>> y = ([1, 1], [1, 1])
        >>> mul(x, y)
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        TypeError: m_b must be a list

Testing y as a tuple
::

        >>> x = [[1.5, 2.5], (3, 4)]
        >>> y = [[1, 1], [1, 1]]
        >>> mul(x, y)
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        TypeError: m_a must be a list of lists

Testing x with a list of tuple
::

	>>> mul(1, 2)
	Traceback (most recent call last):
        TypeError: m_a must be a list

Testing with just number
::

        >>> mul('boy', 2)
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        TypeError: m_a must be a list

Testing with just number
::

        >>> x = [[1.5, 2.5], [3, 4]]
        >>> y = [[1, 1], (1, 1)]
        >>> mul(x, y)
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        TypeError: m_b must be a list of lists

Testing y as a list of tuple
::

        >>> x = [[1.5, 2.5], []]
        >>> y = [[1, 1], [1, 1]]
        >>> mul(x, y)
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ValueError: m_a can't be empty

Testing with an empty row in x
::
	>>> x = [[1.5, 2.5], [3, 4]]
        >>> y = [[1, 1], []]
        >>> mul(x, y)
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ValueError: m_b can't be empty

Testing with an empty row in y
::

        >>> x = [[1.5, 2.5], ['d', 4]]
        >>> y = [[1, 1], [1, 1]]
        >>> mul(x, y)
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        TypeError: m_a should contain only integers or floats

Testing with string in x
::

        >>> x = [[1.5, 2.5], [3, 4]]
        >>> y = [[1, 1], [1, 'a']]
        >>> mul(x, y)
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        TypeError: m_b should contain only integers or floats

Testing with string in x
::

        >>> x = [[1.5, 2.5], [3, 4]]
        >>> y = [[1, 1], [1, 1], [2, 2]]
        >>> mul(x, y)
        Traceback (most recent call last):  
        ValueError: m_a and m_b can't be multiplied

Testing when the columns in x are not the same size as those in y
::

        >>> x = [[1.5, 2.5], [3, 4, 1]]
        >>> y = [[1, 1], [1, 1], [2, 2]]
        >>> mul(x, y)
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        TypeError: each row of m_a must be of the same size

::
Testing if the rows in x are not of the same size

        >>> x = [[1.5, 2.5], [3, 4]]
        >>> y = [[1, 1], [1, 1], [2, 2, 3]]
        >>> mul(x, y)
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        TypeError: each row of m_b must be of the same size

Testing if the rows in y are not of the same size
::

	>>> mul()
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	TypeError: matrix_mul() missing 2 required positional arguments: 'm_a' and 'm_b'

Testing when no argument is passed
::

	>>> mul([1, 2, 3])
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        TypeError: matrix_mul() missing 1 required positional argument: 'm_b'

Testing for when one argument is passed
